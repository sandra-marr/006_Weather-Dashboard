## Weather Dashboard

To create a weather dashboard, a few key components were needed. Input from the user was required, gathering weather data using a weather API, and displaying the relevant information from the response on the screen. 

## Languages and APIs

To complete this application, html, css, boostrap, javascript, jQuery, and a weather API were all used. The html page provided the structure and base components for the layout and the data responses. CSS and Boostrap were both used to style the page and make it responsive. Javascript and jQuery were used along with the weather API to take user input and use it to retrieve the weather data. Once that was done, data was both stored in local memory and displayed on the screen for the current and future weather forecast. 

## Challenges

Working with CSS frameworks is still new, but the ability to make this application responsive was much more attainable with bootstrap. 

It was challenging to learn how to fetch the weather data with the given API. When just using the city input, there was a possibility that the intended city was not displayed. I added in state and country input areas as well in order to correct for this. Since the city name is required, a modal was used tl alert the user if a city name is not entered when the submit button is clicked. There is also an alert when an invalid input is provided by the user.
